UX Spaces are a way of thinking about the needs of the user, the information
you are presenting, and the overall relationship’s between the different
interactions that exist in your digital ecosystem.

This method has been developed over 7 years of building sites in Drupal, and
its evolved from trialing various different practices

This is not a very prescriptive process – it’s mostly about communication…
if you do decide to try it, you should adapt it to fit your specific needs
or the needs of the project.

UX Spaces are a way of representing:
* The needs of the user
* The available data
* The client’s business rules, and
* The interactions required by those factor

Ultimately, a UX Space is actually a thing that you build, it might be a web
page, or just a section within a web page. It might be a particular set of
screens on on a mobile application, or it might be a widget that appears
across your site.
