UX Spaces are a toolkit for thinking about the needs of the user, the information
you are presenting, and the overall relationshipâ€™s between the different
interactions that exist in your digital ecosystem.

Ultimately, a UX Space is actually a thing that you build, it might be a web
page, or just a section within a web page. It might be a particular set of
screens on on a mobile application, or it might be a widget that appears
across your site.
